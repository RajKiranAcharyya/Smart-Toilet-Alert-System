Smart-Toilet-Alert-System
Smart-Toilet-Alert-System is an innovative project designed to integrate real-time alert mechanisms into smart toilet technology. This system enhances hygiene, convenience, and reliability by using IoT-based monitoring and proactive maintenance features. Sensors track water levels, temperature, and occupancy, triggering alerts for malfunctions via SMS, MQTT, or visual/audio signals.

Features
Real-Time Monitoring: Detects water level abnormalities, temperature fluctuations, and occupancy-related issues.
Alert Mechanism: Sends notifications via SMS, MQTT dashboards, and local alarms.
Proactive Maintenance: Reduces downtime with timely alerts for servicing or repairs.
Customizable Notifications: Configurable thresholds and notification preferences.
IoT Integration: Seamlessly connects to smart home systems for remote management.
Technologies Used
